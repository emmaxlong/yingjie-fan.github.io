I am currently a Chemisry Ph.D. candidate at [the University of Chicago](https://chemistry.uchicago.edu), working under the supervision of Dr. [Wenbin Lin](https://chemistry.uchicago.edu/faculty/wenbin-lin). My research focuses on developing a type of crystalline framework materials, including metal-organic framework and covalent-oragnic framework, for photocatalytic organic transformations.
## Research Interest:
- **Materials synthesis:** MOF, COF.
- **Photoredox chemistry**
- **Energy-related photocatalysis**
